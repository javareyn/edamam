# Edamam - Nutritional Analysis
A WIP because I'm following all of the tutorials. And things definitely need work.

## Recipe requests - POST
Requests must be made with ingredients plus measurements (i.e. '1/4 cup cheddar cheese')

## Single food analysis - GET
Requests only made with one food item

## TODO
* REFACTOR
* try-except
* Structure the values in pandas
